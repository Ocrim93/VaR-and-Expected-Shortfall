# VaR-and-Expected-Shortfall
Value at risk (VaR) and expected shortfall (ES) are attempts to provide a single number summarizing the total risk in a portfolio of financial assets.

In the utilities.py you can find two ways to measure the risk of a portfolio with two different approaches:
 - Historical Simulation approach;
 - Model-Building approach (Linear Model).

In addition, in the historical simulation approach, it has been considered appropriate to give more weight to recent scenarios.
